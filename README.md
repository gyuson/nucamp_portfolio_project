Portfolio Project for SQL with Python

Title: Barber Shop Booking App
Description: This is an application for roll-out to barbershops which will help them and their clients coordinate bookings centrally. 
API Reference Table: (to follow)

1. How did the project's design evolve over time? 
I decided to simplify. Initially, I wanted the app to cover multiple barber shops and barbers. To simplify the initial roll out, I decided to just cover one barbershop and its barbers. 

2. Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?
I went with with ORM - the number of tables is not a lot, but I foresee that they would need to be updated the next coming months/years. Also, Iâ€™m quite comfortable with SQL and want to focus on writing Python

3. What future improvements are in store, if any? Potential endpoints for implementation 
    /login
    /schedule
    /cart/items (or services)?
